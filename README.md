# Blog Rework

This project has a dual purpose. Whilst serving as a website rebuild, I am rebuilding a blog site that I had tried to build in the summer. It was very bare non-interactive, so I decided to rework it, both for the benefit of handing it in as an assignment, and for creating blogs in the future.
