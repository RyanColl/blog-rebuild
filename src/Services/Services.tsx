        summary: `Are you looking to make app-creation easier and more fun? In this blog post, I am going to cover Google Firebase's ability to host your app, and store your data, all from the client side. We will be building this app with React, so ensure you have nodeJS installed on your local computer, as well as a runtime environment like VSCode or WebStorm. We will be creating this project with Typescript too, so get prepared to learn a thing or two!`,

            `Whether you are a novice or an experienced web-developer, having the right technologies and guidance make developing fun. That's why I want to bring to you a relatively new full stack application. It'sâ€¦ React, with... Firebase! Read on and I will explain how two stacks can be a full stack, and why we should go serverless for most of our apps.`,
            `We are going to be using the JavaScript framework called React, and the hosting service called Firebase, however Firebase does a lot more than just host, it allows us to make server-less full stack applications with ease.`,
            `Before we start, we will want to ensure we have a code editor installed, like VSCode . After that, we will want to ensure we have NodeJS installed on our machine. We can do that by visiting this link and installing the package. This also installs npm, which we will use for installing our react app. Finally, we can install yarn . Similar to npm, it helps us install packages, however this is optional.`

        summary: `Today I want to introduce you to a full stack that consists of: React Native, Typescript, and Firebase. React Native is a client side library for building mobile applications. Typescript is a super-set of JavaScript, allowing you to name types that gives the computer a better understanding of what your code is doing. Finally, Firebase is a server, database, and much more, all bundled up into one.`,
